# React + Vite

This is a fully dynamic web application built using React and the 'react-leaflet' library. The application visualizes data related to different regions. The region data is currently static and can be modified as needed, sourced from the 'data/data.js' file.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. **Clone this project to your local machine:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/codebreaker-02/ISimplexity-Assignment-24.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd ISimplexity-Assignment-24
    ```

3. **Install project dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Now, you can access the application locally by visiting [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your web browser. Feel free to explore and make any necessary adjustments to the region data based on your requirements.
